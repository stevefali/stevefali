<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steven Faliszewski - Software Engineer</h1>

I am a family man living in Kamloops, British Columbia with my wife and kids.
I got started coding by learning Android development, working on other personal projects, graduating from the Software Engineering bootcamp at BrainStation, and then working at BrainStation as a Teaching Assistant. I honed my technical skills and learned how to effectively collaborate with others during the software development process.  

In my current role, I am doing some AI training work on [Outlier.ai](https://outlier.ai). It has been very interesting helping to train AI models to get better at coding. I have actually learned quite a lot from it in a short time! It's a bit like spending all day doing code review ;) One of the interesting challenges (that has helped me learn and grow a lot) is that, since the samplings of coding tasks vary so much and so wildly, it has really been pushing my knowledge to the next level - working on tasks that involve frameworks, languages, concepts, and features I have never seen before.

My previous role as a Software Engineering Teaching Assistant with BrainStation was a really great experience because it helped solidify my knowledge of Software Engineering, and also challenged me to help students with their technical questions and help them debug their projects (debugging other people's code over Zoom is an extra challenge). My past work experience has taught me creative problem solving and the importance of attention to detail. 

What sets me apart is my experience at BrainStation as both a student and a Teaching Assistant, and also my experience on the personal projects that I have made. One of my favorite projects is my Minecraft mod, [Mega Randomizer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mega-randomizer), which I made using Java. This project makes me grin every time I think about it, both because it now has over 14,000 downloads, and because I had so much fun making it! It required me to learn how Minecraftâ€™s large codebase works, and then work out how to make the modifications I wanted, while ensuring quality and reliability, as well as compatibility with other mods.  This project now has other versions of it as well, since users have asked me to make the mod for older versions of Minecraft, so it has grown into a few projects instead of just one. With Mega Randomizer, I have also focused on maintaining high code quality and clean code. I am also proud to say that this project has attracted the attention of another developer who has made contributions to it. I would also like to highlight my BrainStation capstone project, [DrugBug](https://drugbug.netlify.app/), which is a full stack web application for tracking medications and looking up medication interactions. The thing I am most proud of on this project is having taught myself how to do web push notifications. 

I would also like to point out my Android app, [Weather Quest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steve.weatherquest&hl=en_US), which I made using my favorite programming language, Kotlin. Iâ€™ve been playing around with Android development casually as a hobby for around a decade, and my love of it is a big part of what drove my decision to become a professional Software Engineer. One of the reasons I chose to make this app is that it has enough features to demonstrate a set of skills that are essential for any Android Developer, such as UI, animations, REST API integration, device location, permissions, asynchronous operations, databases, and more. I created the UI using Androidâ€™s Jetpack Compose library, and I also used several other popular Android libraries such as Room for SQL databases, Retrofit and Moshi for integrating multiple 3rd party REST APIâ€™s, and Hilt/Dagger for dependency injection/managing singletons. Another thing I am pleased with on this app is having worked out a system to minimize unnecessary network calls from the userâ€™s device. My source code can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stevefali/Weather_Quest) for this project. 

I recently made a small project just for fun called [MegaRand10K](https://github.com/stevefali/MegaRand10K). I noticed that my Mega Randomizer project was nearing 10,000 downloads on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mega-randomizer), so I made a program that would periodically check the number of downloads and send me an email when it reached 10,000. Since then, I have adapted the program to send me an email whenever the downloads reach a certain threshold, such as every 100 downloads. I built this project in node.js and used the [Notification Api](https://www.notificationapi.com) to send the email notifications, the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) library to go to the CurseForge website and check the number of downloads, and the [Bree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bree) library to schedule when to run the check.

I am also easy to get along with, hard-working, and patient. Iâ€™m excited to put these pieces together in my new career as a Software Engineer. 

Please have a look at my public repositories to see the code for my projects. Reach out to me any time for a chat! I can be reached by email at stevefaliszewski@gmail.com or by phone at 1-250-318-5959.
