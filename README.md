<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steven Faliszewski - Software Engineer</h1>

I am a family man living in Kamloops, British Columbia with my wife and kids.
I got started coding by teaching myself Android development, working on other personal projects, graduating from the Software Engineering bootcamp at BrainStation, and then working at BrainStation as a Teaching Assistant. I honed my technical skills and learned how to effectively collaborate with others during the software development process.  

<p>My most recent role as a Teaching Assistant with BrainStation was a really great experience because it helped solidify my knowledge of Software Engineering, and also challenged me to help students with their technical questions and help them debug their projects (debugging other people's code over Zoom is an extra challenge). My past work experience has taught me creative problem solving and the importance of attention to detail. 

What sets me apart is my experience at BrainStation as both a student and a Teaching Assistant, and also my experience on the personal projects that I have made. One of my favorite projects is my Minecraft mod, [Mega Randomizer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mega-randomizer), which I made using Java. This project makes me grin every time I think about it, both because it now has over 6000 downloads, and because of how much fun I had making it. It required me to learn how Minecraftâ€™s large codebase works, and then work out how to make the modifications I wanted, while ensuring quality and reliability, as well as compatibility with other mods. Iâ€™m also proud to say that this project has attracted the attention of another developer in Germany who has made contributions to it. As time has gone by, users have requested the same mod for other Minecraft versions, so this project has grown. I have had a lot of fun lately, remaking Mega Randomizer in different ways to work with different Minecraft versions. I would also like to highlight my BrainStation capstone project, [DrugBug](https://drugbug.netlify.app/), which is a full stack web application for tracking medications. The thing I am most proud of on this project is having taught myself how to do web push notifications. I have been playing around with Android development casually for around a decade, and I recently made an [Android weather app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steve.weatherquest&hl=en&gl=US) using my favorite programming language, Kotlin. Another project I have been working on is [SpigotSteve](https://github.com/stevefali/SpigotSteve), a plugin I made for Spigot Minecraft servers that has a similar basic functionality to Mega Randomizer. I have mainly been using this project for experimenting with Spigot plugin development, and have also used it to have some fun playing around with some slightly more advanced Java features such as reflection.

I am also easy to get along with, hard-working, and patient (my wife and I have 5 children). Iâ€™m excited to put these pieces together in my new career as a Software Engineer. 

Please have a look at my public repositories to see the code for my projects. Reach out to me any time for a chat! I can be reached by email at stevefaliszewski@gmail.com or by phone at 1-250-318-5959.
